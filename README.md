# McCannyManagement
A Managment Software aimed for manage the School's Calender

The Student/Calendar Management Project is a volunteer project, 
the initial motivation of the project is to reduce my counsellor`s 
workflow by creating a program to help her manage student information 
and provide assistant planning the school calendar. 

The program intergrades several built-in features:
<ul>
<li>collusion detection</li>
<li>course hour calculator</li>
<li>course end date estimator</li>
</ul>

The program needs to be able to run efficiently and can handle most of the circumstances.
